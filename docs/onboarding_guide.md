<div align="center">🧭 Nexus Engineering Onboarding GuideThe comprehensive map to the Nexus Multi-Agent Release Automation Platform.</div>1. 🚀 What is Nexus? (The 30-Second Pitch)Think of Nexus as a super-smart Release Manager that lives in Slack.Instead of you manually checking 5 different tools, Nexus orchestrates the work:🧠 Thinks: "User asked for status -> I need to check Jira and Jenkins."⚡ Acts: Securely connects to tools via API.📝 Summarizes: Returns a "Go/No-Go" decision report.It's not just a chatbot. It is a Stateful Multi-Agent System capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex workflows.2. 🏗️ The Architecture: Hub-and-SpokeWe use a Monorepo structure organized like a wheel.ComponentRoleDescriptionThe Hub🧠 OrchestratorThe central brain. Receives Slack messages, plans the workflow using AI, and delegates tasks.The Spokes🤖 AgentsSmall, focused services. Each agent handles ONE tool (Jira, Git, etc.) and reports back to the Hub.3. 📂 Navigating the Code (/services)This is where 90% of your work will happen. Each folder acts as an independent microservice.🧠 The Brainservices/orchestrator/Role: The decision maker. Maintains memory and runs the reasoning loop.Key File: app/core/react_engine.py (The AI Logic).Tech: Python, FastAPI, Gemini AI, LangGraph.🤖 The Hands (Agents)These services wrap external APIs into a standard interface.AgentPurposejira_agent/Translates "Get Ticket" into Atlassian API calls. Handles hierarchy fetching.git_ci_agent/Triggers Jenkins builds, checks GitHub PR status, and runs RCA.slack_agent/The "Ears". Listens to Slack events/commands and forwards them to the Hub.reporting_agent/Generates beautiful HTML dashboards and publishes them to Confluence.⚙️ The Control Panelservices/admin_dashboard/Role: A web UI to manage API keys and configurations without restarting servers.Tech: React (Frontend) + FastAPI (Backend).4. 🔗 The Glue (/shared)We hate repeating code. Common logic lives here to keep agents lightweight.📦 shared/nexus_lib/schemas/The Contracts: Defines data models like JiraTicket. Ensures the Orchestrator and Agents speak the same language.🛡️ shared/nexus_lib/middleware.pySecurity & Metrics: Automatically handles token validation and request counting for every service.5. 🛠️ How It Runs (/infrastructure)We use Docker to containerize everything. No "it works on my machine" issues.docker-compose.ymlThis magic file spins up the entire world with one command:🗄️ Postgres: For saving state (Memory).⚡ Redis: For fast configuration caching.🚀 Orchestrator + 5 Agents: All connected on a private network.6. 💻 Your First ContributionReady to ship code? Follow this flow:Pick a Card: Find a Jira ticket (e.g., "Add support for Trello").Create the Agent:Copy the jira_agent folder.Rename it to trello_agent.Define the Contract:Go to shared/nexus_lib/schemas.Define what a TrelloCard looks like.Implement Logic:Write the code to talk to the Trello API using our AsyncHttpClient wrapper.Register:Add the agent to docker-compose.yml.Tell the Orchestrator about the new tool.Test:./setup_local_env.sh
docker-compose up
Pro Tip: Stuck? Check tests/e2e/. We have end-to-end tests that trace a request from start to finish!
